High-Level Architecture
VulnScout is built on a modular architecture with several key components:

1. Core Scanner**: The central component that orchestrates the scanning process
2. Progress Tracker**: Real-time monitoring and display of scan progress
3. Analysis Modules**: Specialized components for specific types of analysis
4. Reporting Engine**: Multi-format report generation system
5. Data Storage**: Caching and persistence layer
6. Visualization Engine**: Data visualization components

Main Classes and Components

Config
Centralized configuration with environment awareness, handling all settings for the scanner.

 VulnerabilityScanner
Main scanner class implementing the core scanning logic and orchestrating different scanning phases:
- Target validation
- Port scanning
- Service detection
- Vulnerability scanning
- Network analysis
- Report generation

 ScanProgress
Advanced progress visualization with multiple metrics, providing real-time feedback on scan status.

SocketIOClient
Robust Socket.IO client with reconnection and fallback capabilities for real-time monitoring.

Scanning Methodology

The scanner follows this multi-phase approach:

1. Target Validation:
   - DNS resolution
   - Reverse DNS lookups
   - WHOIS information gathering
   - GeoIP location
   - Basic connectivity testing

2. Port Scanning:
   - SYN scanning for TCP ports
   - UDP port scanning
   - Service fingerprinting
   - TCP traceroute

3. Service Detection:
   - Version detection with Nmap
   - SSL/TLS analysis for secure services
   - HTTP header analysis
   - OS fingerprinting

4. Vulnerability Scanning:
   - Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) vulnerability checks
   - Custom vulnerability checks (directory traversal, XSS)
   - SSL/TLS vulnerability testing (Heartbleed, POODLE)
   - Security header compliance checking

5. Network Analysis:
   - Network topology mapping
   - Attack path identification
   - Risk assessment

6. Reporting:
   - Multi-format report generation
   - Interactive visualizations
   - Data export capabilities

 Key Technical Features

Asynchronous Scanning
The scanner uses asyncio for non-blocking I/O operations, allowing concurrent scanning of multiple services and ports.

Real-time Monitoring
Socket.IO integration provides real-time updates and monitoring of scan progress.

Extensibility
The modular design allows for easy addition of new vulnerability checks and scanning capabilities.

Visualization
Integrated data visualization using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for clear representation of scan results.

Error Handling
Comprehensive exception handling and logging throughout the application.

Caching
Redis integration for caching scan results and improving performance.

Optional Elasticsearch Integration
Support for storing and searching scan results in Elasticsearch.
