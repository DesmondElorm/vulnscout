# VulnScout Vulnerability Scanner 

 Project Overview
VulnScout will becomee an enterprise-grade security assessment platform designed to provide comprehensive vulnerability scanning, real-time monitoring, advanced visualization, and detailed reporting of network security postures. This project combines multiple security tools and methodologies into a single, unified application with an emphasis on depth of analysis and clarity of reporting.

Key Features
- Multi-phase security scanning including target validation, port discovery, service enumeration, and vulnerability detection
- Network topology mapping and attack path visualization
- Risk assessment with severity categorization
- SSL/TLS security analysis with vulnerability detection (Heartbleed, POODLE, etc.)
- HTTP security header analysis
- Real-time scan progress monitoring with rich interactive interface
- Comprehensive reporting in multiple formats (PDF, HTML, JSON, CSV, XML, Markdown, SVG, PNG)
- Visualization of vulnerabilities and network infrastructure
- Extensible architecture with plugin support for custom vulnerability checks

Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+ with asyncio for concurrent scanning
- Nmap for port scanning and service detection
- OpenSSL for certificate and TLS/SSL analysis
- NetworkX for graph-based network analysis
- Rich for terminal UI and progress display
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data visualization
- Redis for caching and temporary data storage
- ElasticSearch (optional) for result indexing and searching
- Socket.IO for real-time communication
- FastAPI for potential web interface
